# Network Echo - a server-client interaction in C++

"Multiplayer Explained" workshop held by Gameloft - server & client app using winsock.

Implemented a server-client interaction in C++ using winsock, in which the
server waits for the client to send messages, receives them, displays them and
sends a response message to the client that also displays it.
